                    <p>Day by day, you'll see a coin that instantly bonds, runs a little bit and then gets one-candled to zero. These are what the community calls "crash coins", named after the notorious crash games in gambling in which players try to cash out before a rising multiplier crashes.</p>
                    
                    <p>They're fast paced, they're extremely addicting and most of all, unpredictable. This is the exact type of environment that thrives on-chain, and pushes many traders to try "sneaking into the bundle" for the chance to hit the jackpot.</p>
                    
                    <p>Most of the time this never works and you're instantly down 99%, but what if? What if you managed to successfully sneak in and win? You'd be one of the crashcoin survivors.</p>

                        <p>Crash coins tend to emerge right after a runner occurs on-chain; they'll steal the exact token metadata of the runner and they'll bundle it up to (usually) around 100k market cap. After the coin bonds, It's a coin toss as to whether they decide to one-clip it after around 100-200k market cap.</p>
                        <p>The majority of crash coins occur when the market is hot, but they can spawn at any time.</p>

                        <p>Crash coins as we know it today emerged around November of 2024, when the trenches were hitting its stride and has almost reached prime status. Originally they used to get a significant amount of human buys, as knowledge of bundling and tools in general were weaker back then, so crash coin deployers were essentially donated free money.</p>
                        <p>Nowadays though, only a few even dare to buy these types of coins, as they know what the outcome will be 9 times out of 10.</p>

                        <p>In terms of who's behind these crash coins, there are many potential suspects. There's speculation that they could be tied to North Korean/chinese groups as a method to wash funds, but another theory is that it could be Pump.fun themselves. The Pump.fun team could potentially be behind it to inflate certain stats, such as market cap, volume and migration count.</p>
                        <p>While all of this is speculation, it's still intriguing as to who could be behind these daily recurring coins. Crash coins provide an easy way to wash ill-gotten gains without the hassle of going through multiple mixers.</p>
                        <p>Profit would be out of the question entirely, as trading fees would make it so that they could lose a lot of money if they don't get any bids.</p>
